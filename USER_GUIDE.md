# Bhartiya Nyay AI — User Guide  
*(For Advocates & Legal Professionals)*

---

## 👩‍⚖️ Who Is This For?

Bhartiya Nyay AI is designed for:

- Solo Advocates  
- Junior Lawyers  
- Small Law Firms  
- Criminal Law Practitioners (BNSS / BNS)

You do **not** need any technical knowledge to use this system.

---

## ❓ What Does Bhartiya Nyay AI Do?

Bhartiya Nyay AI helps you **draft legally structured court documents** under the new criminal law regime (BNS / BNSS).

It assists you by:
- Organising case facts
- Mapping IPC sections to BNS sections
- Supporting arguments with relevant case law (if available)
- Generating a first draft for your review

⚠️ Important:  
This system **does not give legal advice** and **does not replace your judgment**.  
You remain fully responsible for the final draft.

---

## 🧭 How the System Works (Simple Overview)

Bhartiya Nyay AI follows the same steps a real advocate follows:

1. Select the type of draft  
2. Enter case facts  
3. Check legal section mapping  
4. Review judicial precedents (if any)  
5. Generate draft  
6. Review and edit  
7. Export for court filing  

No step can be skipped.

## 🪜 Step-by-Step Usage Guide

### **Step 1: Create a New Draft**

- Choose the draft type  
  (Example: *Regular Bail Application – BNSS*)
- A new draft file is created for your case

---

### **Step 2: Enter Case Facts**

You will be asked to fill facts such as:
- FIR number
- Date of arrest
- Custody duration
- Sections invoked
- Other relevant details

📝 Facts are entered in a structured format (not free typing).

Why this matters:
- Prevents missing important details
- Avoids confusion in drafting
- Reduces risk of AI making assumptions

If a required fact is missing, the system will ask you to complete it.

---

### **Step 3: Legal Mapping (IPC → BNS)**

The system maps:
- IPC sections (if any)
- Corresponding BNS sections
- Legal intent behind the provision

You can:
- Review the mapping
- Understand how old law connects to new law

This step ensures **statutory correctness**.

---

### **Step 4: Judicial Precedent Support (RAG)**

The system checks its judgment database to find:
- Relevant case law
- Matching sections
- Similar legal issues

Two possible outcomes:

#### ✅ If precedents are found:
- Case names
- Court details
- Citations are attached to the draft

#### ⚠️ If no precedents are found:
The system clearly states:
> “No relevant judicial precedent was found in the provided materials.”

No fake or assumed case law is ever shown.

---

### **Step 5: AI Draft Generation**

After facts and law are verified:
- AI generates a structured draft
- Sections like:
  - Cause title
  - Facts
  - Grounds
  - Prayer

AI rules you should know:
- AI uses **only your facts**
- AI uses **only mapped law**
- AI uses **only retrieved case law**
- AI never invents judgments

---

### **Step 6: Review & Edit (Very Important)**

The generated draft is **not final**.

You should:
- Read the draft carefully
- Modify language as needed
- Add arguments or remove unnecessary lines
- Ensure it matches your case strategy

The system assumes **human review is mandatory**.

---

### **Step 7: Export Draft**

Once satisfied:
- Export the draft as a DOCX file
- Format is court-ready:
  - Times New Roman
  - 12 pt font
  - 1.5 line spacing
- Fully editable in MS Word

You can now file or further customise the document.

---

## ⚖️ About Case Law & Citations

- Every citation shown is real and verified
- AI cannot cite cases outside the system
- If no case law is available, the system will say so clearly

This protects you from:
- False authority
- AI hallucination
- Court embarrassment

---

## 🔒 Ethical & Legal Safeguards

Bhartiya Nyay AI:
- Does not auto-file documents
- Does not replace legal reasoning
- Does not make strategic decisions
- Does not guarantee case outcomes

It is a **drafting assistant**, not a decision-maker.

---

## 📌 Current Limitations (MVP)

- Limited draft types
- Judgment database is curated, not exhaustive
- No client case management
- No billing or payments

These features will be added in future versions.

---

## 🧑‍⚖️ Final Note for Advocates

Bhartiya Nyay AI is built to **support**, not replace, advocates.

Your experience, reasoning, and strategy remain supreme.  
The system only helps you draft faster, cleaner, and safer.
